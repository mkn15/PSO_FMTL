# Images Folder - Description of Visuals

This folder contains visual representations of the performance and behavior of the **Partial Sharing Online Federated Multi-Task Learning (PSO-FMTL)** framework for kernel regression.

## List of Images

### 1. User Performance over Iterations
- **File:** User graph over iterations.png
- **Description:** This plot shows the evolution of individual user models over successive iterations. It demonstrates how local models gradually adapt to streaming data and converge to personalized solutions under the PSO-FMTL framework.

### 2. Heatmap 1 - Task-User Assignment (Efficient Case)
- **File:** heat map 1.png
- **Description:** This heatmap visualizes task-to-user assignments, reflecting how workload is distributed among clients. It highlights balanced sharing and efficient adaptation under **Partial Sharing**.

### 3. Heatmap 2 - Task-User Assignment (Less Efficient Case)
- **File:** heatmap 2.png
- **Description:** This heatmap represents an alternative scenario, showing uneven task assignments under **less optimized sharing conditions**, illustrating the importance of controlled partial sharing.

### 4. Coordinated Performance Summary (Optional)
- **File:** coordinated.png
- **Description:** (Optional - If relevant to your work) This plot can be retained to show overall model convergence under a globally aware coordination framework. Remove if unnecessary.

### 5. Uncoordinated Performance Summary (Optional)
- **File:** uncoordinated.png
- **Description:** (Optional - If relevant to your work) This plot can be retained to show model fluctuations in an uncoordinated update scenario. Remove if unnecessary.
