# PSO-FMTL

This repository contains code for **PSO-FMTL** - a Particle Swarm Optimization-based Federated Multi-Task Learning framework.

## Description

PSO-FMTL is designed for federated settings where multiple tasks with autoregressive data are learned collaboratively. The approach combines:

- Feature selection matrix for each task.
- Regularization techniques.
- Coordination and uncoordinated variants.

The code simulates learning and compares RMSE for various settings.
